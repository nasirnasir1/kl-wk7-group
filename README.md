GAME HUB is the place where people go to kill some time on the command line. Yes, it looks like you're hard at work in the terminal, but you're gaming away on classics that have been retrofitted for the terminal.

## GAME HUB Games

### Dad Jokes
Dad Jokes in an interactive bash game that prompts you enter a dad joke topic. The game will return a funny and you can keep the laughs going as long as you keep entering a topic. I know the jokes are good, but don't steal them and try to quit your day job. 

### Nursery Rhymes 
Can't quite remember what all the lines in a nursery rhyme are??? Well fear not as this game provides you with a few nursery rhymes to choose from and shows you all the lyrics to that particular nursery rhyme. I hope you have the courage the sing along!!!

### Rock, Paper, Scissors
You probably already know how to play

### Hangman
Test your vocabulary and try to spell the word before hangman exacts judgement on you. Depending on the word length, you get a number of tries before....:skull_and_crossbones:
